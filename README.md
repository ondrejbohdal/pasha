# PASHA: Efficient HPO and NAS with Progressive Resource Allocation
## Abstract
Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) are methods of choice to obtain the best-in-class machine learning models, but in practice they can be costly to run. When models are trained on large datasets, tuning them with HPO or NAS rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive for practitioners, even when efficient multi-fidelity methods are employed. We propose an approach to tackle the challenge of tuning machine learning models trained on large datasets with limited computational resources. Our approach, named PASHA, extends ASHA and is able to dynamically allocate maximum resources for the tuning procedure depending on the need. The experimental comparison shows that PASHA identifies well-performing hyperparameter configurations and architectures while consuming significantly fewer computational resources than ASHA.

## How to use
This repository extends the open-source Syne Tune library and provides a Jupyter notebook to reproduce our experiments.

In order to run the notebook, it is necessary to install Syne Tune. We have installed the full version of Syne Tune using `pip install -e .[extra]`.

In order to run experiments using NASBench201 it is necessary to build the dataset using the provided Syne Tune scripts. In particular you need to run `python nasbench201_import.py` that is in `syne_tune/blackbox_repository/conversion_scripts/scripts`. Note that this requires a lot of RAM memory, so it may be needed to have at least 32GB RAM.

The Jupyter notebook to replicate our experiments is located in `notebooks` directory, and it is called `PASHA-ICLR23.ipynb`. 

PASHA is available also within [Syne Tune library](https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune), together with a [short tutorial](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/pasha/pasha.html).

This package provides state-of-the-art distributed hyperparameter optimizers (HPO) with the following key features:
* wide coverage (>20) of different HPO methods for asynchronous optimization with multiple workers, including:
  * advanced multi-fidelity methods supporting model-based decisions (BOHB and MOBSTER)
  * transfer-learning optimizers that achieve better and better performance when used repeatedly
  * multi-objective optimizers that can tune multiple objectives simultaneously (such as accuracy and latency)
* you can run HPO in different environments (locally, AWS, simulation) by changing one line of code
* out-of-the-box tabulated benchmarks available for several domains with efficient simulations that allows you 
  to get results in seconds while preserving the real dynamics of asynchronous or synchronous HPO with any
  number of workers

## Installing

To install Syne Tune from pip, you can simply do:

```bash
pip install 'syne-tune[extra]==0.3.0'
```

or to get the latest version from git: 

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune.git
cd syne-tune
pip install -e '.[extra]'
```

You can see the FAQ [What are the different installations options supported?](docs/faq.md) for more install options.

See our [change log](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the latest version. 

## Getting started

To enable tuning, you have to report metrics from a training script so that they can be communicated later to Syne Tune,
this can be accomplished by just calling `report(epoch=epoch, loss=loss)` as shown in the example bellow:

```python
# train_height.py
import logging
import time

from syne_tune import Reporter
from argparse import ArgumentParser

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = logging.getLogger()
    root.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--steps', type=int)
    parser.add_argument('--width', type=float)
    parser.add_argument('--height', type=float)

    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    report = Reporter()

    for step in range(args.steps):
        dummy_score = (0.1 + args.width * step / 100) ** (-1) + args.height * 0.1
        # Feed the score back to Syne Tune.
        report(step=step, mean_loss=dummy_score, epoch=step + 1)
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

Once you have a script reporting metric, you can launch a tuning as-follow:

```python
from syne_tune import Tuner, StoppingCriterion
from syne_tune.backend import LocalBackend
from syne_tune.config_space import randint
from syne_tune.optimizer.baselines import ASHA

# hyperparameter search space to consider
config_space = {
    'steps': 100,
    'width': randint(1, 20),
    'height': randint(1, 20),
}

tuner = Tuner(
    trial_backend=LocalBackend(entry_point='train_height.py'),
    scheduler=ASHA(
        config_space, metric='mean_loss', resource_attr='epoch', max_t=100,
        search_options={'debug_log': False},
    ),
    stop_criterion=StoppingCriterion(max_wallclock_time=15),
    n_workers=4,  # how many trials are evaluated in parallel
)
tuner.run()
```

The above example runs ASHA with 4 asynchronous workers on a local machine.
